## 🏆 Walrus Haulout Hackathon 2025

**Track:** Provably Authentic (Truth Engine + Trust Oracle)

**Problem Statement:**

Traditional AI oracles suffer from a critical trust problem: users must blindly trust that operators run AI models honestly and report results accurately. There's no way to verify:
- Which AI model was actually used
- What input data was fed to the model
- Whether the output was tampered with
- If the reasoning stored matches what was claimed

**Our Solution:**

Walmarket eliminates oracle trust requirements through **verifiable AI execution**:

1. **Nautilus TEE** - AI inference runs in secure enclaves with cryptographic attestation proving execution integrity
2. **GPT-5 Single Model Policy** - Consistent, reproducible results with fixed prompts and schemas
3. **Walrus Evidence Storage** - Complete audit trail (input, output, reasoning) stored immutably
4. **SUI On-Chain Verification** - Smart contracts validate TEE signatures, enclave registry, and blob hashes
5. **Economic Security** - Stake, slash, and challenge mechanisms ensure honest reporting

**Result:** The world's first prediction market oracle where AI execution is cryptographically proven, not trusted.

---

## 🎯 Overview

Walmarket is the **world's first verifiable AI oracle** for prediction markets, combining Nautilus TEE, GPT-5, and SUI blockchain to create trustless, cryptographically-proven market resolution. Built for the Walrus Haulout Hackathon 2025 (Provably Authentic track), Walmarket eliminates the need to trust oracle operators by running AI inference inside secure enclaves with remote attestation.

### Why Walmarket?

- **🔐 Nautilus TEE Integration**: AI inference runs in secure enclaves with cryptographic attestation, proving execution integrity
- **🤖 Verifiable AI Oracle**: GPT-5 predictions verified through TEE signatures, enclave registry, and on-chain validation
- **📊 Immutable Evidence Storage**: Complete audit trail (input, output, reasoning) stored permanently on Walrus
- **⚡ On-Chain Verification**: SUI smart contracts validate TEE attestation, aggregate reports, and enforce slashing
- **💰 Trustless Resolution**: No operator trust required - cryptographic proofs guarantee honest execution
- **🎨 Retro Gaming Aesthetics**: Unique pixel art design inspired by Walrus branding

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 1. Verifiable AI Oracle with Nautilus TEE
- **Trusted Execution Environment**: GPT-5 inference runs inside Nautilus secure enclaves
- **Remote Attestation**: Each report includes enclave signature (mrenclave) proving execution integrity
- **Multi-Source Verification**: AI agents cross-reference multiple trusted data sources
- **Evidence Bundle Storage**: Complete input/output/reasoning stored on Walrus with blob hash verification
- **On-Chain Validation**: SUI smart contracts verify TEE signatures against enclave registry whitelist
- **Replay Protection**: Timestamps and nonces prevent report replay attacks

### 2. USDT-Based Prediction Markets
- Create custom prediction markets on any real-world event
- **USDT Trading**: All markets use USDT stablecoin (6 decimals) for predictable value
- Binary outcome markets (YES/NO) with transparent odds
- Market categories: Crypto, Technology, DeFi, Politics, Infrastructure
- Real-time odds based on collective wisdom and pool ratios
- Volume tracking and participant statistics
- **Walrus Metadata**: Market details stored immutably on Walrus for auditability

### 3. Wallet Integration
- **Supported Wallets**:
  - Sui Wallet
  - Suiet Wallet
  - Ethos Wallet
  - Slush Wallet
  - Morphis Wallet
  - Glass Wallet
  - All wallets compatible with @mysten/dapp-kit
- One-click connection
- Secure transaction signing

### 4. Walrus Storage Integration
- **Market Metadata Storage**: Full market details (descriptions, images, sources) stored on Walrus
  - `walrus_metadata_blob_id` stored on-chain for each market
  - Rich metadata beyond on-chain storage limits
  - Immutable market documentation
- **Oracle Evidence Bundle**: Complete AI oracle reports stored on Walrus
  - Input data and sources used for resolution
  - GPT-5 reasoning and analysis
  - TEE attestation and cryptographic proofs

**Example Walrus Usage:**
```typescript
// Market Creation
1. Upload metadata JSON to Walrus → get blob_id
2. Call create_market(title, description, category, end_date, blob_id)
3. Market stores blob_id on-chain, anyone can fetch full metadata

// Oracle Resolution
1. AI generates evidence bundle with reasoning + sources
2. Upload evidence to Walrus → get blob_id
3. Call resolve_market(outcome, evidence_blob_id)
4. Anyone can verify AI decision by fetching blob from Walrus
```

### 5. User Experience

## 🪝 Git Hooks

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to ensure code quality before commits and pushes.

### Pre-commit Hook
Automatically runs before each commit:
- **Lint check**: Validates code style with ESLint

### Pre-push Hook
Automatically runs before pushing to remote:
- **Frontend build test**: Ensures `npm run build` succeeds
- **Contract build test**: Validates SUI Move contracts (if `sui` CLI is installed)

This prevents broken code from being pushed to the repository, ensuring main branch stability.

## 💡 How It Works

### AI Oracle Architecture with Trusted Data Sources

1. **Data Collection**: AI agents monitor multiple trusted data sources
   - **Crypto Markets**: CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Coinbase, Binance APIs
   - **Traditional Finance**: Bloomberg, Reuters, Yahoo Finance
   - **Sports**: ESPN, Official League APIs
   - **Politics**: AP News, Reuters, Fox News, Official Government Sources
2. **Multi-Source Verification**: Cross-reference data from at least 3 independent sources
3. **TEE Execution**: Run GPT-5 inference inside Nautilus secure enclave
4. **Cryptographic Attestation**: Generate TEE signature and remote attestation proof
5. **Walrus Storage**: Store evidence bundle (input, output, reasoning) permanently on Walrus
6. **On-Chain Verification**: SUI smart contract verifies TEE attestation and blob hash
7. **Market Resolution**: Aggregate verified reports and distribute winnings

### Verifiable AI Execution with Nautilus TEE

- **Execution Integrity**: AI inference runs in secure enclaves, preventing operator tampering
- **Remote Attestation**: Each report includes cryptographic proof of execution (mrenclave, signatures)
- **Enclave Registry**: On-chain whitelist of authorized enclaves with epoch-based key rotation
- **Replay Protection**: Timestamps and nonces prevent report replay attacks
- **Hash Verification**: Input/output hashes link on-chain reports to off-chain evidence on Walrus

**Example Oracle Evidence Bundle (stored on Walrus):**
```json
{
  "market_id": "0xabc123...",
  "question": "Will BTC reach $100,000 by Dec 2025?",
  "outcome": "YES",
  "resolution_date": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z",

      "btc_price": "$102,450"
    },
    {
      "name": "CoinGecko",
      "url": "https://coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin",
      "timestamp": "2025-12-31T20:01:00Z",

      "btc_price": "$102,420"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Based on 3 independent sources (CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Binance), Bitcoin's price was confirmed above $100,000 on December 31, 2025. Average price: $102,416. All sources agree the threshold was exceeded.",
  "tee_attestation": {
