## 🏆 Walrus Haulout Hackathon 2025

**Track:** Provably Authentic (Truth Engine + Trust Oracle)

**Problem Statement:**

Traditional AI oracles suffer from a critical trust problem: users must blindly trust that operators run AI models honestly and report results accurately. There's no way to verify:
- Which AI model was actually used
- What input data was fed to the model
- Whether the output was tampered with
- If the reasoning stored matches what was claimed

**Our Solution:**

Walmarket eliminates oracle trust requirements through **verifiable AI execution**:

1. **Nautilus TEE** - AI inference runs in secure enclaves with cryptographic attestation proving execution integrity
2. **GPT-5 Single Model Policy** - Consistent, reproducible results with fixed prompts and schemas
3. **Walrus Evidence Storage** - Complete audit trail (input, output, reasoning) stored immutably
4. **SUI On-Chain Verification** - Smart contracts validate TEE signatures, enclave registry, and blob hashes
5. **Economic Security** - Stake, slash, and challenge mechanisms ensure honest reporting

**Result:** The world's first prediction market oracle where AI execution is cryptographically proven, not trusted.

## 🎯 Overview

Walmarket is the **world's first verifiable AI oracle** for prediction markets, combining Nautilus TEE, GPT-5, and SUI blockchain to create trustless, cryptographically-proven market resolution. Built for the Walrus Haulout Hackathon 2025 (Provably Authentic track), Walmarket eliminates the need to trust oracle operators by running AI inference inside secure enclaves with remote attestation.

### Why Walmarket?

- **🔐 Nautilus TEE Integration**: AI inference runs in secure enclaves with cryptographic attestation, proving execution integrity
- **🤖 Verifiable AI Oracle**: GPT-5 predictions verified through TEE signatures, enclave registry, and on-chain validation
- **📊 Immutable Evidence Storage**: Complete audit trail (input, output, reasoning) stored permanently on Walrus
- **⚡ On-Chain Verification**: SUI smart contracts validate TEE attestation, aggregate reports, and enforce slashing
- **💰 Trustless Resolution**: No operator trust required - cryptographic proofs guarantee honest execution
- **🎨 Retro Gaming Aesthetics**: Unique pixel art design inspired by Walrus branding

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leopard627/walmarket.git
cd walmarket
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
# SUI Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_NETWORK=testnet

# Optional: Add your custom RPC endpoints
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_RPC_URL=https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
```

### Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🔧 Smart Contracts

Walmarket includes SUI Move smart contracts for on-chain prediction markets.

### Build Contracts
```bash
cd contracts
sui move build
```

### Test Contracts
```bash
cd contracts
sui move test
```

### Deploy to Testnet
```bash
cd contracts
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

📚 **For detailed contract documentation, see [contracts/README.md](./contracts/README.md)**

## 🪝 Git Hooks

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to ensure code quality before commits and pushes.

### Pre-commit Hook
Automatically runs before each commit:
- **Lint check**: Validates code style with ESLint

### Pre-push Hook
Automatically runs before pushing to remote:
- **Frontend build test**: Ensures `npm run build` succeeds
- **Contract build test**: Validates SUI Move contracts (if `sui` CLI is installed)

This prevents broken code from being pushed to the repository, ensuring main branch stability.

## 💡 How It Works

### AI Oracle Architecture

1. **Data Collection**: AI agents monitor multiple trusted data sources
2. **Multi-Source Verification**: Cross-reference data from at least 3 independent sources
3. **TEE Execution**: Run GPT-5 inference inside Nautilus secure enclave
4. **Cryptographic Attestation**: Generate TEE signature and remote attestation proof
5. **Walrus Storage**: Store evidence bundle (input, output, reasoning) permanently on Walrus
6. **On-Chain Verification**: SUI smart contract verifies TEE attestation and blob hash
7. **Market Resolution**: Aggregate verified reports and distribute winnings

### Verifiable AI Execution with Nautilus TEE

- **Execution Integrity**: AI inference runs in secure enclaves, preventing operator tampering
- **Remote Attestation**: Each report includes cryptographic proof of execution (mrenclave, signatures)
- **Enclave Registry**: On-chain whitelist of authorized enclaves with epoch-based key rotation
- **Replay Protection**: Timestamps and nonces prevent report replay attacks
- **Hash Verification**: Input/output hashes link on-chain reports to off-chain evidence on Walrus
