## 🏆 Walrus Haulout Hackathon 2025

**Track:** Provably Authentic (Truth Engine + Trust Oracle)

**Problem Statement:** Traditional prediction markets lack transparency and rely on centralized resolution mechanisms. Users must trust operators to fairly resolve outcomes, and there's no way to verify the authenticity of market resolutions.

**Our Solution:** Walmarket combines the wisdom of prediction markets with AI-powered verification and Walrus storage to create an unstoppable truth infrastructure where outcomes are cryptographically verified and permanently stored on-chain.

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git
- A SUI-compatible wallet (Phantom, Sui Wallet, etc.)

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/leopard627/walmarket.git
cd walmarket
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
# SUI Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_NETWORK=testnet

# Optional: Add your custom RPC endpoints
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUI_RPC_URL=https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
```

### Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🔧 Smart Contracts

Walmarket includes SUI Move smart contracts for on-chain prediction markets.

### Build Contracts
```bash
cd contracts
sui move build
```

### Test Contracts
```bash
cd contracts
sui move test
```

### Deploy to Testnet
```bash
cd contracts
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

📚 **For detailed contract documentation, see [contracts/README.md](./contracts/README.md)**

## 🪝 Git Hooks

This project uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to ensure code quality before commits and pushes.

### Pre-commit Hook
Automatically runs before each commit:
- **Lint check**: Validates code style with ESLint

### Pre-push Hook
Automatically runs before pushing to remote:
- **Frontend build test**: Ensures `npm run build` succeeds
- **Contract build test**: Validates SUI Move contracts (if `sui` CLI is installed)

This prevents broken code from being pushed to the repository, ensuring main branch stability.

## 💡 How It Works

### AI Oracle Architecture

1. **Data Collection**: AI agents monitor multiple trusted data sources
2. **Multi-Source Verification**: Cross-reference data from at least 3 independent sources
3. **TEE Execution**: Run GPT-5 inference inside Nautilus secure enclave
4. **Cryptographic Attestation**: Generate TEE signature and remote attestation proof
5. **Walrus Storage**: Store evidence bundle (input, output, reasoning) permanently on Walrus
6. **On-Chain Verification**: SUI smart contract verifies TEE attestation and blob hash
7. **Market Resolution**: Aggregate verified reports and distribute winnings

### Verifiable AI Execution with Nautilus TEE

- **Execution Integrity**: AI inference runs in secure enclaves, preventing operator tampering
- **Remote Attestation**: Each report includes cryptographic proof of execution (mrenclave, signatures)
- **Enclave Registry**: On-chain whitelist of authorized enclaves with epoch-based key rotation
- **Replay Protection**: Timestamps and nonces prevent report replay attacks
- **Hash Verification**: Input/output hashes link on-chain reports to off-chain evidence on Walrus
